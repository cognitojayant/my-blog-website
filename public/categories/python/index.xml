      <description>What is Memory Management? Memory management is a procedure by which applications or program to read and write some data from memory. A memory manager determines where to put application’s data. Since there’s only a finite chunk of memory available to us.
This process of giving access to memory to a program or application is by in large called memory allocation. On top of hardware layers such as RAM or a hard drive is their an operating system (OS) layer which consists of a Kernel which can be considered as the operating system code that is responsible for interaction of hardware and software components.</description>
