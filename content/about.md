## Summary

> **"It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment" ~ Carl Friedrich Gauss**

Hey, my name is Jayant Jha currently working as Machine Learning Scientist at a organization [**EZLab**](https://www.ezworks.io) based out of Gurugram, Haryana, India.  Given my effort and inquisitiveness to learn and understand, i gets awed by the nature that how little i know. In all  wilderness of space and time,  I am still trying to understand only some of the Physical systems.   My affection for Mathematics, doing and learning things from first principle brings me closer to the Machine Learning.  As **Richard Feynman** said

> "**What I cannot create,  I do not understand**"

I have learned machine learning and deep learning from massive collections of available Literature's and MOOC's. Main purpose of this blog is to augment my understanding of mathematical and technical detail about machine learning, deep learning and computer science fundamentals.

## Development Tools

I like to be tool agnostic, so for that i like continuously learning new tools as to add up in my skillset as well as for the new problem comes and evolve. As if now, I can code in `C/C++`, `Julia`, `MATLAB`, `Python`, `R` and `Scala`. But currently most of my  work done using `Python` and `Shell Scripting`.

I like to read research papers and interpret its contents in a simplest possible ways.
